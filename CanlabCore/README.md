CanlabCore
==========

This repository contains core tools for MRI/fMRI/PET analysis from the Cognitive and Affective Neuorscience Lab (Tor Wager, PI) and our collaborators.  Many of these functions are needed to run other toolboxes, e.g., the CAN lab’s multilevel mediation and Martin Lindquist’s hemodynamic response estimation toolboxes. A brief introduction to the toolbox can be found <a href = "http://canlab.github.io/CanlabCore">here</a>.

We have several sources of documentation:

1.  For a walk-through of a common basic processing pipeline, see our <a href='https://canlabreposguide.hackpad.com/CANLab-Repository-Guide-aGTiWJr0zbt'>hackpad</a>
2.  For function-by-function help documents on the Core Tools objects and functions, see the <a href = http://canlabcore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>help pages on Readthedocs</a>.
3.  For brief, documented code examples of some specific functions, see <a href='https://github.com/canlab/CANlab_help_examples'>CANlab_help_examples github repository</a>
